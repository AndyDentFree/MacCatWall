# MacCatWall
Building a paywall for RevenueCat macOS SwiftUI.

As of [April 2025][rc1] there was no official paywall product for SwiftUI macOS apps.

This repo contains results of [asking ChatGPT5][gpt1] to generate SwiftUI code to match two existing screens and the refinement of that into a working app. To simplify things, it's just being built as a macOS app.


## Paywall screenshots from iOS
These screenshots from the [Purrticles app][p1] on iOS were used to prompt chat.
