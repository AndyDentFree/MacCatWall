Assets.xcassets
- added colors sometimes repeating, so they are there for different roles vs light/dark
  - OutlineFeatures used for outline & check background on selected panel and the feature icons
- single-mode BrightHighlight and DemureBlue

PaywallView
- Apply new colors from assets including OutlineFeatures so have different in dark/light
- Remove most hardcoded white and black colors so correct system defaults in dark/light
- Remove most of the ZStacks
- Remove .clipShape on header
- Remove ""// Fake stacked cards behind the header" which was ChatGPT noticing the screenshot shows the paywall presented in a modal sheet
- Remove bizarre .onChange(of: selectedTab) logic as that's all handled by the binding
- Replace hardcoded font sizes with use of system styles
- FeatureRow
  - add .multilineTextAlignment(.leading)
  - overlays vary stroke color by isSeleected
  - simplify circle drawing, use SFSymbol conditional on isSeleected

ColorCrossPlatformExtensions.swift
- added so have systemBackground can use on both
